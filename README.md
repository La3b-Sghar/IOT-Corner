# 🌐 IoT-Corner

This repository contains all the components related to the **Internet of Things (IoT)** integration for our renewable energy hackathon project. It includes all Raspberry Pi-based code for sensor data collection and communication with the AI models.

## 📁 Contents

- 📄 **Raspberry Pi Code**  
  The core scripts to read data from industrial sensors (temperature, pH, flow rate) and communicate with the backend system (API or database).  
  - Collects real-time data
  - Sends sensor data to the AI system for analysis

- ⚙️ **Sensor Integration Code**  
  Code for integrating specific sensors:
  - **DHT22** (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)  
  - **pH Sensor** (for water quality)
  - **Flow Rate Sensor**  
  - **Pressure Sensor** (if applicable)  
  - **MPU6050 (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)** (if used for monitoring system orientation or movement)

- 🌍 **Communication Protocols**  
  Code for sending sensor data to the cloud/server using:
  - **MQTT**  
  - **HTTP API**  
  - **WebSocket**  
  (Configure your IoT device to communicate with the backend for AI model analysis)

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Raspberry Pi (Model 3B/4 recommended)  
- Python (with necessary libraries: `RPi.GPIO`, `Adafruit_DHT`, `pH-Sensor`, `requests`, `paho-mqtt`)
- MQTT/HTTP for communication  
- Sensor libraries and drivers specific to your IoT sensors

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you have all required Python libraries installed.  
- Check the pinout for Raspberry Pi if using GPIO-based sensors.
- This IoT setup can be used in conjunction with the AI models from the **AI-Corner** repository for real-time data analysis and predictions.
